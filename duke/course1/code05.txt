// write your code here
/* Part 3
Write code to change the Duke blue devil (the image below on the left) to be yellow (as in the image below on the right).

Start by working this smaller example by hand. You want to turn the image below on the left into the image below on the right. What are the steps you will need to take? Once you have worked through this example by hand to determine the steps you will need to take, you can translate your algorithm into code.
