// write your code here
/*Part 2
Your friend is trying to write a program that draws a square 200 pixels by 200 pixels and that looks like this square with colors red (red value 255), green (green value 255), blue (blue value 255) and magenta (red value 255 and blue value 255). All other RGB values are set to 0.
Your friend has written code to try to solve this problem, however their code has a bug, and produces this image
Here is their code:
Your task is to find and fix the bug. Use what you have learned about applying the scientific method to debugging: gather information, apply your knowledge about images and programming, form a hypothesis, test your hypothesis, and finally, change the code to fix the problem.
